You write the JavaScript and CSS, we make it fast.

Say your website has these references:
<pre>
<script src='http://cnd.sdfioj.google.com/jquery.min.js'></script>
<script src='http://cnd.sdfioj.google.com/underscore.min.js'></script>
<script src='http://yoursite.com/site.coffee'></script>
<link href='http://cnd.sdfioj.google.com/jquery-ui.min.css'/>
<link href='http://yoursite.com/site.less'/>
</pre>

Each of these assets makes a separate request, so loading takes a while.

If you're smart, you use some kind of bundler to manually combine all the assets. 
That means your assets take 2 requests instead of 5 (much better).

But if you've ever messed with a bundler, you know that setup can be a
huge pain - especially if you're using coffee, less, or sass. And wouldn't
1 request be better than 2? And now that you're bundling everything, you
don't get the incredible response rate of a CDN. 

MonsterSmash is insanely simple solution to this whole mess. 
<pre>
<script src='http://monstersmash.com?jquery-ui,underscore,http://yoursite.com/site.coffee,http://yoursite.com/site.less'></script>
</pre>

BOOM!

Monster smash combines all your scripts and css into one file,
caches it in a blazing-fast redis database, and pushes it to CDNs
across the country for the fastest response times you've ever seen.

Notice a couple of features:
'jquery-ui' isn't a url, it's a known library
